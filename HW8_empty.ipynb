    "Some interesting geometric curves can be described recursively. One famous example is the Koch curve. It is a curve that can be infinitely long in a finite amount of space. It can also be used to generate pretty pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Koch curve is described in terms of \"levels\" or \"degrees\". The Kock curve of degree 0 is just a straight line segment. A first degree curve is formed by placing a \"bump\" in the middle of the line segment. The original segment has been divided into four, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original. The bump rises at 60 degrees, so it forms two sides of an equilateral triangle. To get a second-degree curve, you put a bump into each of the line segments of the first-degree curve. Successive curves are constructed by placing bumps on each segment of the previous curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can draw interesting pictures by \"Kochizing\" the sides of a polygon. You are to write a program to draw a snowflake. Think of drawing a Koch curve as if you were giving instructions to a turtle. The turtle always knows where it currently sits and what direction it is facing. To draw a Koch curve of a given length and degree, you might use an algorithm like this:\n",

    "Algorithm Koch(Turtle, length, degree):\n",
    "    if degree == 0:\n",
    "        Tell the turtle to draw for length steps\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        length1 = length/3\n",
    "        degree1 = degree - 1\n",
    "        Koch(Turtle, length1, degree1)\n",
    "        Tell the turtle to turn left 60 degrees\n",
    "        Koch(Turtle, length1, degree1)\n",
    "        Tell the turtle to turn right 120 degrees\n",
    "        Koch(Turtle, length1, degree1)\n",
    "        Tell the turtle to turn left 60 degrees\n",
    "        Koch Turtle(length1, degree1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemenet this algorithm with a Turtle class that contains instance variables `location` (a `Point`) and `Direction` (a float) and methods such as `moveTo(somePoint)`, `draw(length`, and `turn(degrees)`. If you maintain direction as an angle in radians, the point you are going to can easily be computed from your current location. Just us dx = length * cos(direction) and dy = length * sin(direction)."
